Play tic tac toe with another player in the console

I was working through the challenges on [Python Principles](https://pythonprinciples.com/challenges/) when I came across [one](https://pythonprinciples.com/challenges/Tic-tac-toe-input/) that challenges you to convert a player string into a tuple ("A3"=(2,0)) for the imagined purpose of creating a tic-tac-toe game. So I put my attempt in and then challenged myself to expand that into an actual tic-tac-toe game that you can play in the console.

Almost extactly 1hr 45 mins later, I had a version I was happy with.

Next logical step will be to allow the player to play versus the computer.
